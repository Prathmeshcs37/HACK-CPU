The HACK computer, including CPU, ROM and RAM
*
*   Abstraction:A computer capable of running programs written in the Hack machine language
*   Implementation : Built from the Hack chip-set.
*
*   Input: reset
*   Function: When reset is 0, the program stored in the computer's
*             ROM executes. When reset is 1, the execution of the
*             program restarts. Thus, to start a program's
*             execution, reset must be pushed "up" (1) and then "down" (0).
